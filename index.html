    To my love...
    <div class="dear">
    Dear Football,
       <div class="tribute-body">
        You taught me Geography. You taught me Friendship. You taught me how to love a club in their defeats and winnings. 
        You taught me love hurts but I cant leave your love. You kept me awake at nights and the next day I woke up early 
        to play football.I bunked classes to play football. Now I am getting old. I have stopped staying awake to watch you 
        mesmerize me with those free kicks and bicycle kicks. I am so afraid of everything now. So afraid that 
        my team "Manchester United" will lose that I dont even care about them winning or losing. 
        It hurts me when people say so many things about my club. I am a fan,I don't get money for my support, 
        I can't even go to Old Trafford to watch them play. I dont get time to watch you play.
        I am always thinking why should I watch you as it is not helping me in any way. This are hard times, 
        I have no idea what the future holds. But I don't want to loose you. Whatever may happen. Just promise me football 
        that you will never change. Even if I start to hate you, you will always have a place in my heart. Those UEFA Champions League
        and FIFA World Cup nights I will never forget them. Thankyou for teaching me where Ecuador is! And for teching 
        me how to speak Italian. Thankyou!!!

    Yours faithfully,
